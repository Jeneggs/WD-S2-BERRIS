## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

This project serves as a mock resume in the form of a website. This project gives a quick introduction about myself, the things I've achieved, things I love, and things I'm capable of. Through this project, I was able to exercise and display my skill in building a website using the powers of HTML and CSS. 

Guiding Question:

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
